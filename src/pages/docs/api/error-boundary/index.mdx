# ErrorBoundary

`ErrorBoundary` is a component that catches errors in its child component tree, preventing the entire 
application from crashing. When an error occurs, the `fallback` prop is rendered instead of the 
component tree.

You can provide a simple JSX element as the `fallback`, or a function that receives the error and 
returns JSX. Additionally, you can use the `onError` prop to handle errors (e.g., for logging).

### Example

<CopyInnerText>
{siteCodeLang.value === "js" ? <ExampleCode /> : <ExampleCodeTS />}
</CopyInnerText>
